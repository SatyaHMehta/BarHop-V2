# miniProject

## Description

Our goal was to build a app that would allow a user to enter a city in the search bar and get a list of bars in that city, then allow the user to generate a route using the bars that they have selected and write a review on that route.

```md
1. search for a city:
    * see bar cards with an image, address, phone#, and rating.

2. select the bars that you want to visit by clicking the "Add" button:
    * see the bar card name generate in the search pane as a button

3. click "generate route":
    * see a route generated on the map. starting point is the first bar you select.
    
4. click "write a review":
    * write a review on the route you have generated.

```
